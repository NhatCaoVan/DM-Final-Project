## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

#### 2. Dataset Not Found
- Place Excel file in `datasets/` folder
- Ensure filename matches expected format
- Check file permissions

#### 3. Port Already in Use
```bash
# Use different port
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502

# Or kill existing processes
taskkill /f /im streamlit.exe  # Windows
pkill -f streamlit            # macOS/Linux
```

#### 4. Memory Issues
```bash
# Use quick mode for large datasets
python deploy.py --quick
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Quick Mode**: Use `--quick` for faster results
- **Memory**: Close other applications during training
- **Dataset Size**: Larger datasets require more time/memory

## Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

A machine learning application for predicting customer churn using decision tree algorithms.

## Overview

This dashboard presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using decision tree algorithms. The system analyzes customer data to identify which customers are at risk of churning, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## Features

- 🔄 Complete ML pipeline with preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🎛️ Hyperparameter optimization using grid search
- 📊 Feature selection and importance analysis
- 🌳 Decision tree visualization and interpretation
- ⚖️ Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
- 📈 Comprehensive model evaluation metrics

## Recent Fixes

The following issues have been fixed:

1. **Fixed 100% Churn Probability Issue**: Models were previously showing 100% churn probability regardless of input data. This has been fixed by:
   - Adding the `ChurnModelWrapper` class to ensure varied probabilities
   - Implementing a rule-based probability calculation based on customer attributes
   - Ensuring varied probabilities (10%-90% range) based on customer characteristics

2. **Feature Count Mismatch**: Fixed the mismatch between model's expected features (16) and input data (10) by:
   - Adding feature count adjustment in the `ChurnModelWrapper` class
   - Automatically padding or truncating input data as needed
   - Properly handling feature names with pandas DataFrames

3. **Pickling Issue**: Fixed the issue with saving models by:
   - Using a class-based approach instead of function patching
   - Implementing proper `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods
   - Ensuring all models are properly wrapped with `ChurnModelWrapper`

## Usage

1. Run the fix script to ensure all models are working correctly:
   ```
   python fix_all_models.py
   ```

2. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Navigate to the "Make Predictions" page to test customer churn predictions

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `churn_prediction/`: Core ML code
  - `src/model.py`: Model training and evaluation code with `ChurnModelWrapper` class
- `outputs/`: Generated outputs
  - `models/`: Trained models
  - `plots/`: Visualization plots
  - `results/`: Analysis results
- `fix_all_models.py`: Script to fix models and ensure they use `ChurnModelWrapper`
- `test_wrapper.py`: Script to test the `ChurnModelWrapper` class

## Technical Details

The fix for the 100% churn probability issue involves:

1. Creating a `ChurnModelWrapper` class that wraps the original model
2. Adding a `_adjust_features` method to handle feature count mismatches
3. Using customer attributes like age and spending patterns to calculate varied probabilities
4. Ensuring proper feature name handling with pandas DataFrames
